CS50 final project: DNA traits selection and inheritance estimation.

This web application allows the user to input any number of genes that is 2 or higher. The user then inputs the dominant and recessive traits for each gene as well as the symbol they would like to represent the allele. After the user selects the parents genotypes using dropdowns they can choose to calculate all possible offspring's genotypes and phenotypes or to calculate for an offspring with a specific phenotype through dropdown fields. They are then able to select the genotype from one of the offspring to go into the next generation by picking the parents genotype.
