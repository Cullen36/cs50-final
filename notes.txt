tbh i kind of want to do something with the background but im unsure what
^^^^^^^^^^^^
okay

use 'he' to represent heterozygous, hr for homozygous recessive, and hd for homozygous dominant.
^^^^^^^^^^^^
i've set those values in the form. how will this be stored? do we need a list for each parent of their values for each trait?

so all the math ive done so far boils down to that you can do a punnett square for each trait seperately. for example two parents who are heterozygous for all traits have a 50% to
produce an offspring which caries both the dominant and recessive genes for the first trait. within that 50% there is another 50% for those kids to have both the dominant and recessive
genes for the second trait. this continues.



chance function (p1, p2, dom_s, rec_s): ex "Rr" x "Rr"
    # format symbols

    n1 = dom_s + dom_s

    n2 = dom_s + rec_s

    n3 = rec_s + rec_s
    
    # decide base case
    if either parent is hd
        if only 1 is hd
            if other is he
            # he + hd 
                return {
                    'hd':[0.5, n1], 
                    'he':[0.5, n3]
                    }
            # hd + hr
            else
