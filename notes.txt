tbh i kind of want to do something with the background but im unsure what
^^^^^^^^^^^^
okay

use 'he' to represent heterozygous, hr for homozygous recessive, and hd for homozygous dominant.
^^^^^^^^^^^^
i've set those values in the form. how will this be stored? do we need a list for each parent of their values for each trait?

so all the math ive done so far boils down to that you can do a punnett square for each trait seperately. for example two parents who are heterozygous for all traits have a 50% to
produce an offspring which caries both the dominant and recessive genes for the first trait. within that 50% there is another 50% for those kids to have both the dominant and recessive
genes for the second trait. this continues.
