Should decide on a styling format to use.
^^^^^^^^^
will probably use similar styling as Finance - tbh i kind of want to do something with the background but im unsure what

use 'he' to represent heterozygous, hr for homozygous recessive, and hd for homozygous dominant.

so all the math ive done so far boils down to that you can do a punnett square for each trait seperately. for example two parents who are heterozygous for all traits have a 50% to
produce an offspring which caries both the dominant and recessive genes for the first trait. within that 50% there is another 50% for those kids to have both the dominant and recessive
genes for the second trait. this continues.
